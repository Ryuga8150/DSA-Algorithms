## Brief Explanation of Folders:

- **disjoint set**: Implementation of the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) or Union-Find algorithm.
- **divide and conquer/mergeSort:** Merge Sort and other divide-and-conquer-based algorithms.
- **fenwick trees:** Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) implementations for range queries.
- **graph:** Algorithms for graphs, including Eulerian Path and Circuit, MSTs, and more.
- **math:** Mathematical algorithms and number-theory-based problems.
- **segment tree:** Segment Tree implementations for range queries and updates.
- **string:** String algorithms like pattern matching, hashing, etc.
- **trie:** Trie data structure for efficient string operations.

## How to Use

1.  Clone the repository:
